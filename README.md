Make an app showing 3 counters that start at 0

Every counter has a + and a - button
Clicking on + will increase the count number on that single counter
Clicking on - will decrease the count number on that single counter

BONUS:
The page will have 2 extra buttons "decrease all" and "increase all"
Clicking on "increase all" will increase the count by 1 on all the counters
Clicking on "decrease all" will decrease the count by 1 unit on all the counters

NOTES:
- you may use create-react-app to bootstrap the outline of the application
- no redux to be used
- no React hooks to be used
- data does not need to be persisted (ie. on a page refresh, all counters can show 0 again)
